### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking me out!

I'm Kyle, a full-stack developer! For the past 7 1/2 years, I've been working in furniture maufacturing. My responsibilities there led me to learn Visual Basic for Applications to make Excel apps for the company to improve our workflow... and that's where I started to love coding! I'm now finishing a year-long full-stack program and am excited to jump into the world of tech!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my certificate with BloomTech (formerly Lambda School)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Agile/Scrum, AWS and Docker
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything... I'd love the practice!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kyle.e.cardwell@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I collect/build LEGO... usually spaceships

Tech Stack: FE: React.js BE: Node.js DB: PostgreSQL
